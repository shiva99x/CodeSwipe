As mine and my team's first Hackathon, it was quite rushed and hectic but we still made it to the end with just FrontEnd knowledge and ChatGPT.

In Breakathon, we went ahead with the idea of CodeSwipe, It intruigued me as a app where you can find like minded coders or
people who have already worked on the projects you are looking for.

In this we have not only implemented the left and right swipe feature of the CodeSwipe but also
we added a search bar where you can seach among your connections across various keywords such as any language or project.

We also added a Fun Daily Challenge Section in the HomePage, Players will be awarded points based on it and enhance their profile,
These coding questions can be a topic of discussion between the connections.
ALso added a Profile Section, Where the Player can see his details.
Not to mention, The beautiful Interface, created by team, The Penguins!
